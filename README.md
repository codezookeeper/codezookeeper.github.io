## TODO:

 * Gather topics from presentation video
 * Gather topics from linters and resharper - explain their suggestions
 * write description of behavior instead of implementation
 * create links and folders for class/species etc
 * rough out homepage
 * change top bar header links
 * create folders and language tags for C#
 * Update web icon - favicon
 * Attach something like Google analytics
 * attach comment system - https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/

## Topics:

 * Learning center - iterations on iterations presentation
 * LC - dishonest methods
 * Ex - make static
 * LC - minimap check for DRY
 * Ex - true and false are code smells -> return conditions
 * Ex - reduce if statements
 * Ex - combine nested if statements
 * Ex - inline temporary variables
 * Ex - remove redundant null checks
 * LC - change names when refactoring
 * Ex - unnecessary ToList
 * Ex - single line await
 * Ex - ToList better than ToArray
 * LC - Arrays are bad and you should feel bad
 * Ex and/or LC - don't just split long methods into many short one time called sections to get smaller methods
 * Ex and/or LC - don't hide complex switching logic behind types (inheritance w/ overrides can be very difficult!)
 * Safari - inline a bunch of methods to find common logic for clean refactor

## Thoughts:

 * Create sections for:
  * Exhibits
  * Learning center
  * Softskills (need name)
  * Safari - PRs to open source with links to exhibits and learning center content
   * Live footage -> vlog?
  * Keepers - Just Anthony and Sean for now but if others contribute, they should be featured
   * Find funny zoo titles like “Elephant Excrement Expert” or “Assistant to the Anteater” or “Safari Supply Supervisor”
 * Accept public PRs?
 * License page -> creative commons?
  * As long as hosting costs are near free, there’s no need to make a revenue model
